We are given a .pcap file that we can analyze using Wireshark tools. The first thing you do is to look for information inside the file, such as data protocols or messages found in those protocols, as shown in the image below. The result shows several lengthy data with a length of 4714 in the TCP protocol. This indicates the presence of a flag in that data. Then, we export the data as raw data named 'data.raw.' However, the data raw cannot be opened yet due to the absence of a name header signature. After some time of searching, I found a suitable name header signature, which is ZIP with hexa code '50 4B 03 04' and ASCII code 'PK..' You simply add it at the beginning of the file and save it as 'raw.zip.' Then, there is a file located inside the folder. The question is, what is the flag in 'xl/sharedStrings.xml'.
