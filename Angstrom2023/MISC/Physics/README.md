zsteg is a tool used to identify and extract hidden data (steganography) from images. Steganography is the practice of hiding confidential data or messages in media files such as images, audio, or video without significantly changing the appearance or quality of those files.
zsteg is used specifically to identify and extract hidden data in PNG and BMP format images. This tool can help identify the type of steganography used in the image and extract the data hidden in it.
zsteg can be run from the terminal and used by providing the name of the image file to be inspected. This tool works by analyzing image bits and metadata to find hidden data that may be in it.
